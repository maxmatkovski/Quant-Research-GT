**Why do Hedge Funds exist if many can't beat the market?**

• Hedge funds aim for absolute returns regardless of market conditions, using sophisticated strategies and greater flexibility than mutual funds[1].

• They potentially offer higher returns and diversification benefits, but come with substantial fees and increased risks[1].

• Historical data shows many hedge funds have underperformed the S&P 500 index over long periods[1].

• Hedge fund returns often exhibit negative skewness, meaning they can experience occasional extreme losses[1].

• Funds of hedge funds offer diversification across multiple hedge funds but have a double-fee structure, which can significantly impact returns[1].
